# ---------

# Python does not have a built-in array data type.
# You can use "Python's list" as an array.
# However, if you need a more efficient array implementation.
#   You can use the "array" module.
import array
# A special variable, which can hold many values under a single name.
# You can access the values by referring to an index number.

"""Indexed Arrays """
# List and Arrays are indexed, meaning each character has a unique number, obtaining individual characters.
#   The first character (counting right to left) is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
#     The last character (counting right to left) is at index -1, the second to last at -2, and so on.

""" Slice index"""
# An indexed list can be sliced, allowing you to obtain a substring.
#   The slice is defined by two indexes, the first and the last.

#           The slice is defined by the syntax [first:last].
#               Following the  logical string recomposition rule: s[:i] + s[i:]
#                   The length of a slice is the difference of the indices

""" INDEX Methods """
# List methods are functions that can be used to manipulate lists.
#   They are called on a list object and can be used to perform various operations on the list.

#  append()   Adds an element at the end of the list
#  clear()	  Removes all the elements from the list
#  copy()	  Returns a copy of the list
#  count()	  Returns the number of elements with the specified value
#  extend()	  Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
#  index()	  Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
#  insert()	  Adds an element at the specified position
#  pop()	  Removes the element at the specified position
#  remove()	  Removes the item with the specified value
#  reverse()  Reverses the order of the list
#  sort()     Sorts the list
