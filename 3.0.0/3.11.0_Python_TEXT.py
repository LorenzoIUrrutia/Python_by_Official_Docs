# ----------

""" Python handles text using the String type, known as strings, "Str". """
# Stings are IMMUTABLE, meaning they cannot be changed after creation.

""" Simple strings """
#   These can be characters, words, names, or full sentences
#       Enclosed in single (') or double(") quotes interchangeably.

print("Hello World!")
# Hello World!

""" Quotes inside quotes """
# If you want to include a quote inside a string, as characters. 
#   Place a backslash (\) before each quote.

print("Hello \"World!\"")
# Hello "World!"

# OR

# Use different quotes to enclose the string.
#   As long they don't match the quotes surrounding the string

print("Hello 'World!'")
# Hello 'World!'

# ----------

""" Multiline strings """
# One way is using triple-quotes (""") or (''') inside the print() function.

It can span multiple lines.
It is useful for long text or documentation.

# It can span multiple lines.
# It is useful for long text or documentation.
 
""" Avoid the automatic initial line break """
# Inside the Print() function
#   Add a backslash (\) at the end of the first line.
#       The backslash (\) is not printed, but it indicates that the line continues on the next line.

""" Line breaks """
# (Line breaks inside a Print() function, generate a new line in the output)
# Use "\n" as a line break character inside the Print() function.
#   The "\n" character is not printed, but it generates a line break in the output.

print("Hello \nWorld!")

# World!

# "\n" is included as part of the Str content.
# Not included in the print() function as a line break.

"""Indexed strings"""
# Strings are indexed, meaning each character has a unique number, obtaining individual characters.

#       The first character (counting right to left) is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
#           The last character (counting right to left) is at index -1, the second to last at -2, and so on.
