# ----------

""" Python INDENTATION """
#  Indentation is used to define the scope of a block of code.
#    It is crucial for defining the structure of the code.
#      Its not an option, its a requirement.
#        Usually 4 spaces are used, but it can be as long as it needs.
#          It has to be at least one.
#           Nerver mix tabs and spaces in the same file.

if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
  
# Have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code
#  If you use a different number of spaces in the same block of code.
#    Otherwise, it will raise an IndentationError

if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")
else:
    print("Five is not greater than two!")
    
#  File "<python-input-0>", line 3
#    print("Five is greater than two!")
# IndentationError: unexpected indent

# ----------

""" Comments """
# Comments are text not printed in the output, completely ignored by the interpreter during execution
#   Use "#" to indicate a comment.

""" Multi-line Comments """
# Python does not have a native syntax for multi-line comments
#   Use multiple lines of code with # as comments
# OR
#  Use triple quotes (''' or """) to create a multi-line string to simulate block comments
#       Technically, these are string literals, not true comments. 
#           The triple quotes are not printed in the output, but they are included in the code.

# ----------

""" Variables """
# Variables are used to store data values.
#  And refers to a memory address in which data is stored.

""" Creating Variables """
#  Python has no command for declaring a variable
#   To created, simply assign a value to it using the equals sign (=).
#    Do not need to be declared with any particular type
#     You can even change type after they have been set

""" Naming in Python """

#  Each additional word starts with an uppercase letter.
