""" 5.5.0_Python_CONTINUE_STATEMENT """

# ----------

# The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration.
#  When a continue statement is encountered, the remaining code in the loop for the current iteration is skipped.

    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"Found an even number {num}")

# Found an even number 2
# Found an odd number 3
# Found an even number 4
# Found an odd number 5
# Found an even number 6
# Found an odd number 7
# Found an even number 8
# Found an odd number 9

""" Example using a continue statement: Filtering even numbers """
# Filter out even numbers from a list.

for n in numbers:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        continue

# Odd number found: 1
# Odd number found: 3
# Odd number found: 5

""" Use of "continue" in loops """
# The continue statement can be used in both for and while loops.
#  It provides a way to skip the current iteration based on a condition.
